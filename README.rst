Advantages and disadvantages of process models
-------------------------------------------------

Before an experienced data scientist would entertain model specific questions like should I use a frequentist or Bayesian paradigm? or is there enough data for a neural network? they will take time to identify and clarify the business problem. Independent of which process is used this is often the first structured step as you apply data science to a problem.

There are a number of reasons to consider a formalized process when carrying out data science.

1. Time allocation: Due to the nature of data science work, it can be a challenge to properly allocate time to complete a project. Having a formalized process in place can help with the overall estimation and it empowers you to make course corrections as you proceed through the stages.

2. Avoid unnecessary tangents: The process of carrying out data science can be conceptualized as a giant flow chart, where branches can have a large number of choices. Under these circumstances, it can be easy to stray off track. A formalized process helps keep you pushing forward towards a minimal viable product.

3. Minimize the model selection process: The optimal solution to a problem, or the one that is most relevant to the business case, is not necessarily the first one that will come to mind. By approaching a problem with an investigative and procedural mindset you are more likely to ask questions that will guide you towards the most appropriate model and solution.

The major disadvantage to using process models is the fact that there are several to choose from and it is possible that none of the existing models are an ideal fit for you or your team. One of the motivating factors for developing this course is that design thinking is both flexible enough and structured enough that it can be applied easily across a diverse set of business problems. Another disadvantage of process models is that strict adherence could promote a tendency to follow recipes in a procedural fashion, which could stifle creative new ways to address business opportunities.

Scientific thinking
----------------------

Scientific thinking should be present at all stages of any process model that is adopted by a company.  The assignment is focused on scientific thinking and serves as a review of basic Python programming skills in data science.

Getting started
--------------------

Open the Jupyter notebook that is present in the `assignments` folder.  The instructors will provide you will a link to submit the assignment once you have finished.
