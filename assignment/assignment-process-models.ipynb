    "The notion of *degree of belief* is central to scientific thinking. It is somehow a part of our human nature to believe statements that have little to no supporting evidence. Another way of thinking about the amount of available evidence is that it is the process of quantifying uncertainty.  The notion of a degree of belief can be formalized using [Bayes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem). For your reference here is a paper that [discusses the notion of degree of belief](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/degree-of-belief).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment it suffices to know that with more evidence available, ideally in the form of repeated independent experiments, ones degree of belief should change. Evidence is derived from the scientific process and if we have none to beging with then we are stuck at the question stage and a proper scientific hypothesis cannot be made.  Recall the scientific process.\n",

    "1. Formulate the question\n",
    ">Does Colorado have better skiing than Utah?\n",
    "2. Generate a hypothesis to address the question\n",
    ">It is commonly said that fresh powder is essential for better skiing.  Not knowing which state has more snowfall on average we hypothesize that the average amount of fresh snow between Colorado and Utah are different.\n",
    "3. Make a prediction\n",
    "4. Conduct an experiment\n",
    "5. Analyze the data and draw a conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to step through the scientific process in this assignment using the above stated hypothesis.  There are ways using experimentation (surveys, blinded studies etc) to test if one state has better skiing more directly, but **the hypothesis should be written in a way that is appropriate given the available data**.  So let's load the data for a ski resort in Colorado and another in Utah."

A built-in safeguard for scientific thought is that our degree of belief never reaches 100%, which leaves some room to find new evidence that could move the dial in the other direction."
